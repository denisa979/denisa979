👋 Hi, I’m @denisa979
🌻 I’m interested in test automation, software quality, and continuous integration.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced API testing with Postman and RestAssured.
🦋 I'm practicing coding and LOVE it, unlike my family who recently had to eat burned dinner 🙈
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source test automation projects.
📫 How to reach me: via LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/denisa-mutapcic-a12951310/overlay/contact-info/].
⚡ Fun fact: Every morning I automate my coffee maker to brew right before my daily stand-up!
